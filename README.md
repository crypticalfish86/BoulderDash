# How to run the game  
Ensure you have JavaFX installed and your runtime recognises the library
Run the Main class, and you should be taken to the main menu.  
There you can choose to display leaderboards or click play.  
Once you click play choose a profile (you can choose to continue or load a new game).  
You should then be taken to a new game or start where the profile left off.  
If you complete all levels then you'll be able to add to the leaderboards!
